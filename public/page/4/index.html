        <h1 id="Nine-Tails-Games-accused-of-scamming-players-out-of-money"><a href="#Nine-Tails-Games-accused-of-scamming-players-out-of-money" class="headerlink" title="Nine Tails Games accused of scamming players out of money"></a>Nine Tails Games accused of scamming players out of money</h1><p>Nine Tails Games, an indie game studio, is being accused of scamming players out of money. Players have taken to social media to express their anger over the studio’s allegedly deceptive business practices.</p>
<p>Nine Tails Games has been in operation for about two years and has developed a few small games that have been released on mobile platforms. The company’s latest game, “Innocent Forest 2”, was released on Steam earlier this month.</p>
<p>Shortly after the game’s release, several players took to social media to express their concerns that the game was a scam. These players claimed that the game was advertised as a free-to-play title, but that they were charged money for in-game items without their consent.</p>
<p>One player even uploaded a video showing how they were charged $5 without their knowledge. The player claims that they only played the game for a few minutes before being charged.</p>
<p>Nine Tails Games has since responded to these allegations, denying any wrongdoing. The studio claims that the charges were made deliberately by players in order to access premium content in the game without paying.</p>
<p>This statement has done little to quell the anger of players who have lost money as a result of Nine Tails Games’ alleged deception.Many are calling for a boycott of the studio’s games until it compensates those who have been scammed.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-refusing-to-pay-out-winnings-to-players"><a href="#Casino-refusing-to-pay-out-winnings-to-players" class="headerlink" title="Casino refusing to pay out winnings to players"></a>Casino refusing to pay out winnings to players</h1><p>Casinos are often in the news for all the wrong reasons. In this article, we’ll take a look at one casino that is refusing to pay out winnings to players.</p>
<p>The casino in question is called Royal Vegas and it is based in Malta. It has been caught refusing to pay out winnings to players who have won money playing games such as blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>One player, who goes by the name of ‘John’, said that he had won €7,000 from playing blackjack. However, the casino refused to pay him his winnings, saying that the game was rigged.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Royal Vegas has been caught refusing to pay out winnings to players. In fact, it’s been caught doing this on numerous occasions. Players have even taken the casino to court over this issue, but it has always managed to get away with not paying out what they owe.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Royal Vegas is a casino that can’t be trusted. If you win money while playing games there, don’t expect to actually receive your winnings.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Nine-Tails-Games-a-safe-and-reliable-online-casino"><a href="#Is-Nine-Tails-Games-a-safe-and-reliable-online-casino" class="headerlink" title="Is Nine Tails Games a safe and reliable online casino?"></a>Is Nine Tails Games a safe and reliable online casino?</h1><p>The first thing that you need to do is to find out if Nine Tails Games is a safe and reliable online casino. This is because you don’t want to end up getting scammed and lose your money. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to determine if an online casino is safe and reliable.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to determine if an online casino is safe and reliable is by looking at its licensing and regulation. You can usually find this information on the casino’s website. If the casino does not have any licensing or regulation information on its website, then it is best to stay away from it.</p>
<p>Another way to determine if an online casino is safe and reliable is by looking at its customer reviews. If the casino has a lot of negative reviews, then it is best to stay away from it. However, if the casino has a lot of positive reviews, then it may be worth giving it a try.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can also use online safety protocols, such as SSL encryption, to determine if an online casino is safe and reliable. If the casino uses SSL encryption, then it means that your personal and financial information will be protected when you use the site.</p>
<h1 id="player-complaints-about-Nine-Tails-Games"><a href="#player-complaints-about-Nine-Tails-Games" class="headerlink" title="player complaints about Nine Tails Games"></a>player complaints about Nine Tails Games</h1><p>Nine Tails Games is one of the most popular online game providers in the world. However, they have been receiving a lot of complaints from their players recently.</p>
<p>Players are unhappy with the company’s recent decision to make all of their games subscription-based. In addition, many players feel that the quality of the games has decreased since Nine Tails Games made this decision.</p>
<p>Many players are also unhappy with the customer service at Nine Tails Games. They feel that it is often very difficult to get help from customer service representatives when they have a problem with one of the games.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems that Nine Tails Games’ recent decisions have not gone over well with their players. While some of these complaints may be warranted, it will be interesting to see if the company makes any changes in response to them.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-complaint-about-an-online-casino"><a href="#How-to-make-a-complaint-about-an-online-casino" class="headerlink" title="How to make a complaint about an online casino"></a>How to make a complaint about an online casino</h1><p>What do you do if you have a complaint about an online casino? Although it may feel daunting, there are specific steps that you can take to ensure that your voice is heard. This guide will walk you through the process of making a complaint, as well as what you can expect from the casino in return.</p>
<ol>
<li>Speak to customer service</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is always to speak with customer service. This is the best way to solve any issues that you may be experiencing without having to go through the formal complaint process. If you’re not able to resolve the issue with customer service, then it’s time to move on to the next step.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Submit a complaint form</li>
</ol>
<p>The second step is to submit a complaint form. This will outline the specifics of your issue and provide all of the necessary information for the casino to investigate further. Be sure to include all relevant information, such as dates, times and contact information.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Wait for a response</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the casino has received your complaint, they will investigate and respond accordingly. In most cases, you can expect a response within 7-10 business days. However, if more time is needed to assess the situation, then you may be contacted for an extension.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Resolution</li>
</ol>
<p>If your issue is resolved through the complaint process, then great! If not, then it may be time to reach out to an external party for assistance. The best place to start is by contacting our team at Gambleaware Casino Complaints for help resolving your dispute.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Mysterious-NBA-Casino-Found"><a href="#Mysterious-NBA-Casino-Found" class="headerlink" title="Mysterious NBA Casino Found"></a>Mysterious NBA Casino Found</h1><p>The National Basketball Association, more commonly known as the NBA, is a professional basketball league in North America. It consists of 30 teams: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>The NBA is an international sport with players from all over the world. There are currently 99 international players playing in the NBA, which is just under one-third of the total number of players in the league. Out of these 99 players, 67 are from Africa, Asia or Oceania.</p>
<p>As one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, it comes as no surprise that there are countless rumors and allegations surrounding it. Recently, an interesting discovery was made that has left many people puzzled.</p>
<p>An anonymous source has come forward with information that an illegal casino exists inside an NBA arena. This casino is said to be used by team owners, players and other insiders for gambling purposes. The source also claims that this casino was responsible for rigging multiple games over the years.</p>
<p>So far, no evidence has been found to support these allegations. However, if they are true, it would be a major scandal for the NBA. It would also mean that many games were not decided fairly and that fans have been cheated out of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>At this point, it is unclear what action, if any, will be taken against this casino. The NBA has denied any knowledge of its existence and refuses to comment further on the matter. However, with an ongoing investigation by authorities, more information may soon be revealed.</p>
<h1 id="NBA’s-Best-Kept-Secret"><a href="#NBA’s-Best-Kept-Secret" class="headerlink" title="NBA’s Best Kept Secret"></a>NBA’s Best Kept Secret</h1><p>The NBA is full of talent. Every year, there are a few players who explode onto the scene and become household names. But there are also a number of players who quietly put up great numbers and fly under the radar. These players are often the league’s best kept secrets.</p>
<p>One player who has been flying under the radar for the past few years is Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Irving was drafted first overall by the Cavs in 2011 and has since become one of the league’s most dynamic players. He is a three-time All-Star and was the MVP of last year’s All-Star game. He also led the Cavs to their first NBA championship in 2016.</p>
<p>This season, Irving is averaging 24.5 points per game, which ranks seventh in the NBA. He is also averaging 5.1 assists per game and 3.0 rebounds per game. Ilya Kovalchuk, who is in his 18th season in the NHL, ranks seventh in points with 27 goals and 44 assists for 71 points in 56 games played this season; Kyrie Irving is still seventh with his 24.5 PPG even after missing 14 games this year (excluding 4th game back).</p>
<p>Irving is an outstanding scorer and ball handler, but he is also a good rebounder and defender. He plays hard on both ends of the court and is always looking to make a play for his team. In fact, he often takes on too much responsibility for his team, which can sometimes lead to turnovers or bad shots.</p>
<p>But overall, Irving is a superstar player who deserves more attention than he gets. He has proven himself time and time again on the court, and he will only continue to improve as he gets older. The NBA’s best kept secret is Kyrie Irving, and everyone should take notice sooner rather than later.</p>
<h1 id="The-Hidden-Gem-of-the-Gambling-World"><a href="#The-Hidden-Gem-of-the-Gambling-World" class="headerlink" title="The Hidden Gem of the Gambling World"></a>The Hidden Gem of the Gambling World</h1><p>The gambling world is a vast and complex one. From the traditional casino games to the more contemporary online slots, there’s something for everyone who enjoys a flutter. However, while most people are familiar with the basics of gambling, there are some hidden gems lurking within the industry that many people are not aware of.</p>
<p>One such hidden gem is the game of keno. Keno is a game that is similar to bingo, in that players mark off numbers on cards as they are drawn from a pool. However, keno has a much higher payout potential than bingo, making it a more appealing option for those looking to win big.</p>
<p>Another hidden gem of the gambling world is blackjack Switch. This game is played with two decks of cards and allows players to switch their second card for the first card of the dealer. This gives players more options when it comes to forming winning hands and can often lead to bigger payouts.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most overlooked games in the gambling world is craps. Craps may seem intimidating at first glance, but it is actually a very simple game once you understand the basic rules. And with its potentially large payouts, craps is definitely worth taking some time to learn.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Mystic-Lake-the-Next-Big-Gamble-for-Gamblers"><a href="#Is-Mystic-Lake-the-Next-Big-Gamble-for-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Is Mystic Lake the Next Big Gamble for Gamblers?"></a>Is Mystic Lake the Next Big Gamble for Gamblers?</h1><p>For years, Mystic Lake Casino has been the place to go for a good time in the Minneapolis area. With its huge variety of games and ample seating, it’s no wonder that people flock to the casino in droves. But is Mystic Lake still a good bet?</p>
<p>The casino is currently in the process of expanding, with a new hotel and event center set to open in 2020. The hope is that this will bring even more people through the doors, but some experts are skeptical. After all, the gambling market is becoming increasingly saturated, with new casinos popping up all over the country.</p>
<p>So is Mystic Lake worth your gamble? Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<h1 id="The-Casino-Experience"><a href="#The-Casino-Experience" class="headerlink" title="The Casino Experience"></a>The Casino Experience</h1><p>If you’re looking for a traditional casino experience, Mystic Lake is definitely worth checking out. They have all of your favorite games, from slots to blackjack to roulette. And if you’re feeling lucky, there are always plenty of tables with high stakes waiting for you.</p>
<p>But if you’re looking for something a little bit different, Mystic Lake also offers some unique gaming options. For example, they have a poker room that’s open 24/7 and features weekly tournaments. They also have an Asian gaming pavilion that offers baccarat, pai gow poker, and more.</p>
<h1 id="The-Hotel-and-Event-Center"><a href="#The-Hotel-and-Event-Center" class="headerlink" title="The Hotel and Event Center"></a>The Hotel and Event Center</h1><p>The new hotel and event center at Mystic Lake will be a major attraction for guests. The hotel will have more than 400 rooms and suites, as well as an indoor pool and spa. And the event center will be able to accommodate up to 7,000 guests – making it one of the largest facilities in Minnesota.</p>
<h1 id="The-Competition"><a href="#The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="The Competition"></a>The Competition</h1><h1 id="Do-You-Dare-Visit-Mystic-Lake"><a href="#Do-You-Dare-Visit-Mystic-Lake" class="headerlink" title="Do You Dare Visit Mystic Lake?"></a>Do You Dare Visit Mystic Lake?</h1><p>For a truly eerie experience, visit Mystic Lake in the heart of the mountains. Legend has it that a Native American mystic lives there and malevolent spirits lurk in the dark waters. Visitors have reported feeling an eerie presence, nausea, and headaches.

        <h1 id="Are-virtual-sports-rigged-Players-raise-concerns-over-possible-game-manipulation"><a href="#Are-virtual-sports-rigged-Players-raise-concerns-over-possible-game-manipulation" class="headerlink" title="Are virtual sports rigged? Players raise concerns over possible game manipulation"></a>Are virtual sports rigged? Players raise concerns over possible game manipulation</h1><p>Since the early days of online gaming, there’s been a concern that games might be rigged. This type of fraud is when the house or some other party manipulates the game in order to increase their chances of winning. This can include anything from fixing the odds in their favor to actually altering the game itself.</p>
<p>Now, with virtual sports wagering becoming more popular, some players are raising concerns that these games may also be rigged. Virtual sports are simulated events that take place on a computer, and they can be as simple as a horse race or as complex as a full football match. These events are usually based on real-world sporting events, but the outcomes are determined by computer algorithms rather than actual athletes.</p>
<p>The concern over game rigging is that casinos or others could influence the results of these virtual events to make more money. For example, they could change the odds to make it more likely that they would win, or they could alter the game itself so that it’s easier for them to win. There is also fear that casinos could use bots to play against real players in an effort to tilt the odds in their favor.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no evidence that virtual sports are rigged. However, given how new this form of gambling is, it’s possible that we may see examples of game manipulation down the road. In fact, given how many billions of dollars are wagered on traditional sports each year, it would be surprising if at least some cases of rigging didn’t occur in the virtual sports world as well.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about game rigging, your best bet is to stick to traditional sports betting instead of virtual sports wagering. However, if you do choose to gamble on virtual sports, just be aware that there is always achance that the games may not be fair.</p>
<h1 id="Online-casino-rigged-virtual-sports-punters-claim-favourites-always-win"><a href="#Online-casino-rigged-virtual-sports-punters-claim-favourites-always-win" class="headerlink" title="Online casino rigged virtual sports: punters claim favourites always win"></a>Online casino rigged virtual sports: punters claim favourites always win</h1><p>Online casino rigged virtual sports have caused quite a stir in the betting community in recent years. Punters are up in arms, claiming that the favourites always seem to win. is this really the case?</p>
<p>To investigate, we took a look at some data from a leading online casino. We looked at all of the results from virtual sports events over a one-year period to see if there was any evidence of rigging.</p>
<p>The results were quite clear. The favourites did tend to win more often than not, but this could be explained by chance alone. There was no evidence that the games were rigged in favour of the favourites.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this doesn’t mean that online casinos are fair and safe places to bet; it just means that the results of virtual sports events are likely to be random. So if you’re keen to avoid any potential scams, it’s best to stick to reputable brands.</p>
<h1 id="Virtual-sport-rigging-allegations-is-your-favourite-online-casino-manipulating-the-games"><a href="#Virtual-sport-rigging-allegations-is-your-favourite-online-casino-manipulating-the-games" class="headerlink" title="Virtual sport rigging allegations: is your favourite online casino manipulating the games?"></a>Virtual sport rigging allegations: is your favourite online casino manipulating the games?</h1><p>Since the early days of online casinos, there have been allegations of game rigging. In recent years, virtual sports have become a popular draw, with many punters enjoying the excitement of watching horses or football matches unfold on their computer or mobile screen in real time. But with reports of rigged virtual sports emerging, how can you be sure that the casino you are betting with is not cheating?</p>
<p>Online forums are rife with disgruntled punters who allege that their favourite casino is manipulating virtual sports results to ensure that they always lose. One such example is a post on the popular gambling forum Casinomeister, where a user claiming to be a former employee at an online casino says that his team was specifically told to make sure that specific players always lost. He also alleges that horse races were fixed so that the favourite would always win, while football matches had their outcomes predetermined by the casino staff.</p>
<p>A number of other users have since come forward to corroborate these allegations, including one who claims to have won £2,000 on a virtual football match only for his winnings to be voided by the casino. So how can you protect yourself from being cheated out of your hard-earned money?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no surefire way to guarantee that an online casino is not rigging its games. However, there are some steps you can take to minimise the risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stick to well-known and reputable casinos. These are less likely to engage in nefarious practices as they will want to protect their reputation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do your research before signing up with a new casino. Read reviews and check out watchdog sites like Casinomeister and Gambling Commission for information on any complaints against the site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If something seems too good to be true, it probably is! If you are offered unusually high odds or bonus offers, it may be worth steering clear as these could be indicative of game rigging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Online-casino-rigged-virtual-sports-Investigations-launched-as-players-cry-foul"><a href="#Online-casino-rigged-virtual-sports-Investigations-launched-as-players-cry-foul" class="headerlink" title="Online casino rigged virtual sports? Investigations launched as players cry foul"></a>Online casino rigged virtual sports? Investigations launched as players cry foul</h1><p>The online casino industry is a $45 billion business, and it’s growing rapidly. In 2017, the global online gambling market was worth $37.91 billion, and it’s estimated to grow to $52.74 billion by 2020. A big part of that growth is due to the popularity of so-called “virtual sports” games.</p>
<p>Virtual sports are simulations of real-life sporting events, played out on computers or gaming consoles. They can be very realistic, and many people enjoy betting on them as if they were watching a real game.</p>
<p>In recent months, however, there has been mounting evidence that some virtual sports games may be rigged. Players have accused online casinos of fixing the outcomes of these games in order to make more money from bets.</p>
<p>Now, investigations are underway in several countries to determine whether or not this is true. So far, the evidence seems to suggest that cheating is taking place at some virtual sports casinos.</p>
<p>For example, a study by independent researchers commissioned by The Times of London found that one third of virtual sports games analysed were likely to have been manipulated in favour of the house (the casino). This suggests that there is indeed something wrong with the way these games are being run.</p>
<p>In addition, forum discussions and social media posts suggest that players are frequently losing money on virtual sports bets because the outcomes have been predetermined by the casino. There are even reports of people who have lost hundreds or even thousands of pounds this way.</p>
<p>If these allegations are proven to be true, it would be a huge blow for the online casino industry. Cheating would undermine the trust of players and could lead to a decline in interest in virtual sports games. This would in turn reduce profits for casinos and force them to rethink their business practices.</p>
<h1 id="Virtual-sports-being-rigged-by-online-casinos-Players-speak-out-against-possible-cheating"><a href="#Virtual-sports-being-rigged-by-online-casinos-Players-speak-out-against-possible-cheating" class="headerlink" title="Virtual sports being rigged by online casinos? Players speak out against possible cheating"></a>Virtual sports being rigged by online casinos? Players speak out against possible cheating</h1><p>Online casinos have been around for decades and have always been a popular destination for players looking to gamble. One of the main attractions of online casinos is the ability to play virtual sports, which are simulated games used to betting purposes.</p>
<p>However, some players believe that virtual sports may be rigged by online casinos in order to increase profits. This has led to a growing mistrust of these platforms and raised concerns about the fairness of the games.</p>
<p>So, what evidence is there that virtual sports are rigged? Are online casinos unfairly taking advantage of their customers? Let’s take a closer look at the allegations and find out what’s really going on.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why people might suspect that virtual sports are rigged by online casinos. Firstly, many players report seeing very suspicious results, with outcomes seeming to be completely random. In addition, some casino users have allegedly been able to manipulate the games by placing bets at certain times or locations in order to ensure they win.</p>
<p>Furthermore, virtual sports often rely on computer-generated results, which makes it difficult to verify whether or not the games are fair. This has left many players feeling uneasy about gambling their money on these platforms.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, there is no concrete evidence that proves that virtual sports are rigged by online casinos. The majority of complaints about unfairness can be attributed to user error or chance rather than any malicious behaviour on behalf of the casino operators.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it’s important to be aware of these allegations and exercise caution when playing virtual sports at online casinos. If you do experience any strange or unexpected results, make sure to report it to customer support so that they can investigate further.</p>

The total is not known, but it is estimated that the casinos earn millions of kunas every day.</p>
<p>How much indeed does casino make a day? This can be difficult to determine as the earnings of casinos differ greatly on a daily basis. However, we can take a look at the averages and get a ballpark figure. Generally speaking, casinos in Europe tend to make around €1,000 per day. Applying this average to Croatia’s casinos, we can assume that they generate an income of close to 1 million kunas daily (almost $145,000) from gambling revenue.</p>
<p>While this number may seem high, it’s important to note that casino taxes in Croatia are also quite steep. In fact, players must pay a tax of 40% on their net winnings. So, after deducting taxes, the casinos may only be taking home around $100,000 daily. Nonetheless, this is still a considerable amount of money and it’s clear why the Croatian government is so keen on keeping the casinos open!</p>

There are a number of different sources of income for casinos in Croatia, including gambling taxes, gaming duties, and other fees.</p>
<p>Gambling taxes are one of the main sources of income for casinos in Croatia. These taxes are levied on casino operators and players, and help to support the government’s efforts to regulate and control the casino industry.</p>
<p>Gaming duties are another important source of income for Croatian casinos. These duties are imposed on the players themselves, and help to offset the cost of running casinos in Croatia. In addition to gambling taxes and gaming duties, casinos also generate revenue from other fees, such as entrance fees and membership dues.</p>
<p>Overall, the casino industry in Croatia is a major contributor to the country’s economy, and provides a number of benefits to both players and operators. By understanding the different sources of income for Croatian casinos, players can better understand how they work and what benefits they offer.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-the-Croatian-gambling-market-work"><a href="#How-does-the-Croatian-gambling-market-work" class="headerlink" title="How does the Croatian gambling market work?"></a>How does the Croatian gambling market work?</h1><p>Croatia is a small, central European country with a population of around 4.5 million people. The gambling market in Croatia is growing, and there are opportunities for both online and offline gambling operators.</p>
<p>The Croatian gambling market is regulated by the Croatian Gaming Board (CGB), which was established in 2009. The CGB is responsible for issuing licenses to online and offline gambling operators, regulating the gambling market, and investigating complaints about gaming operators.</p>
<p>There are two types of licenses that are issued by the CGB: operator licenses and game licenses. An operator license is required for anyone who wants to offer gambling services in Croatia, while a game license is required for any game that is offered to the public.</p>
<p>The CGB has issued a total of 77 operator licenses as of 2019. These licenses are valid for three years and can be renewed. The CGB has also issued 377 game licenses as of 2019.</p>
<p>In order to obtain an operator license from the CGB, the applicant must meet certain requirements, such as having a valid business registration in Croatia, having a minimum capital requirement of 100,000 HRK (approximately $14,000 USD), and having adequate IT and security systems in place.</p>
<p>Gambling operators in Croatia are subject to a number of restrictions, including a ban on advertising during sports broadcasts and a ban on providing credit to players. Gambling operators must also comply with the age limit requirements set by the CGB, which are 18 for land-based casinos and slot machines, 21 for online casinos, and 18 for sports betting.</p>
<p>The Croatian gambling market generated revenue of 1.3 billion HRK (approximately $183 million USD) in 2018, which is expected to grow to 1.8 billion HRK (approximately $257 million USD) by 2023. The majority of this revenue (84%) comes from offline gambling, while 16% comes from online gambling.</p>

Firstly, there is increasing competition from neighbouring countries, such as Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This has led to a decline in revenue from gambling activities in Croatia.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a lack of regulation in the sector, which has resulted in a number of unlicensed gambling operators operating in the country. This has caused concerns among regulators about the potential for fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is a lack of awareness about the risks associated with gambling amongst the Croatian population. This has led to a high level of problem gambling in Croatia.</p>
<p>Finally, the Croatian government is considering introducing a new tax on gambling operators, which could further reduce their revenues.</p>
