        <h1 id="Golden-chance-for-Lithuanians-as-Zalgiris-favourites-against-Madrid"><a href="#Golden-chance-for-Lithuanians-as-Zalgiris-favourites-against-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Golden chance for Lithuanians as Žalgiris favourites against Madrid"></a>Golden chance for Lithuanians as Žalgiris favourites against Madrid</h1><p>The Champions League campaign is heating up and the biggest clash in the round of 16 sees defending champions Real Madrid travel to Vilnius to take on Žalgiris Kaunas. The Spanish giants are overwhelming favourites but Žalgiris will be buoyed by their dominance in the Lithuanian league and will fancy their chances against anyone on home soil.</p>
<p>With 18 titles, Žalgiris are the most successful club in Lithuanian football history. However, they have never progressed beyond the group stages of the Champions League and this is their best chance yet with Los Blancos having been drawn into a tough group that included Roma and Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane’s side had a difficult start to their defence of the Champions League, losing 2-1 away to Roma before scraping past CSKA Moscow 3-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu. They followed that up with an impressive 3-0 win over Galatasaray at home but they will know that they cannot afford to take Žalgiris lightly.</p>
<p>The Lithuanian champions have been in excellent form this season, winning 15 of their 16 league games to open up a five-point lead at the top of the table. However, they have never faced opposition of this calibre and it is likely that they will struggle against Madrid’s quality.</p>
<p>It is sure to be a fascinating tie with plenty of goals and both sides will be desperate to progress to the next round.</p>
<h1 id="Zalgiris-in-a-strong-position-to-take-down-Real-Madrid-in-historic-match"><a href="#Zalgiris-in-a-strong-position-to-take-down-Real-Madrid-in-historic-match" class="headerlink" title="Žalgiris in a strong position to take down Real Madrid in historic match"></a>Žalgiris in a strong position to take down Real Madrid in historic match</h1><p> Žalgiris Kaunas, one of the most successful basketball clubs in Lithuania, will take on Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid in the first game of their two-game series this week. Žalgiris is currently in a strong position to win, as they have home court advantage and are coming off a victory against another Spanish club, Sevilla.</p>
<p>Žalgiris Kaunas was founded in 1944 and has been a dominant force in Lithuanian basketball ever since. The club has won 14 Lithuanian championships and 9 Baltic Championships. They have also reached the Euroleague final twice, in 1992 and 2000. This week’s matchup against Real Madrid will be an important test for Žalgiris as they aim to prove themselves as one of Europe’s top clubs.</p>
<p>Real Madrid is one of the most successful clubs in European basketball history. They have won the Euroleague championship 18 times, more than any other club. They are also regular contenders for the title, reaching the final four times in the last six years. This week’s matchup against Žalgiris Kaunas will be a tough test for them, as Žalgiris is a strong home team.</p>
<p>The first game of this two-game series will be played in Kaunas, Lithuania on Wednesday, October 3rd. The second game will be played in Madrid, Spain on Friday, October 5th.</p>
<h1 id="Zalgiris-odds-on-favourites-to-win-Euroleague-title"><a href="#Zalgiris-odds-on-favourites-to-win-Euroleague-title" class="headerlink" title="Žalgiris odds-on favourites to win Euroleague title"></a>Žalgiris odds-on favourites to win Euroleague title</h1><p>The last time Žalgiris Kaunas won the Euroleague title was back in 1999, but with their dominant display throughout the regular season and playoffs, they are the strong favourites to win the championship this year.</p>
<p>Žalgiris were unbeaten in the Euroleague group stage, winning all six of their games, and they then went on to breeze through the playoffs, beating AS Monaco and Darüşşafaka Doğuş in comprehensive fashion.</p>
<p>Their opponents in the final will be Real Madrid, who themselves have a proud history in Europe’s top club competition. However, Real Madrid were far from convincing in their semifinal victory over Panathinaikos Athens, and Žalgiris will be confident of defeating them in the final.</p>
<p>In addition to their fearsome home court advantage, Žalgiris also have one of the best players in Europe in point guard Vasilije Micić. Micić has been excellent for Žalgiris this season, averaging 17.8 points and 5.5 assists per game.</p>
<p>If Žalgiris can continue playing at this high level, they should be able to lift the Euroleague trophy for the first time since 1999.</p>
<h1 id="Point-spread-for-Zalgiris-game-against-Madrid-released"><a href="#Point-spread-for-Zalgiris-game-against-Madrid-released" class="headerlink" title="Point spread for Žalgiris game against Madrid released"></a>Point spread for Žalgiris game against Madrid released</h1><p>The point spread for the Žalgiris game against Madrid has been released, and it is clear that the Madridistas are favored. Žalgiris will be playing at home, however, and they are not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>Žalgiris comes into this matchup with a record of 2-2, while Madrid boasts a perfect 4-0 record. The European champions opened as 10-point favorites for Wednesday’s game at the Siniora Arena in Kaunas, Lithuania.</p>
<p>Žalgiris has shown promise in their first four games of the season but have yet to notch a victory against a top club. They kicked off their VTB United League campaign with an 85-69 loss to Khimki before bouncing back with home wins over Oldenburg (86-75) and Lietuvos Rytas (88-76). In their last fixture, they were beaten 82-64 on the road by Zenit Saint Petersburg.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Madrid comes into this matchup having yet to face any real competition. They’ve managed to take care of weaker teams such as CAI Zaragoza and Baskonia fairly easily, but Wednesday’s matchup will be their first true test.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Žalgiris has had some success against Spanish clubs in recent years. They defeated Real Madrid 83-77 back in October of 2017 and also took down FC Barcelona 82-79 in February of 2018. Furthermore, they are currently riding a five-game winning streak against Spanish clubs dating back to December of 2017.</p>
<p>All things considered, Žalgiris definitely has a chance to pull off the upset on Wednesday. With that said, they are certainly not expected to win by many people and will likely be heavy underdogs heading into this matchup.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-sports-betting-odds-work-Let-Zalgiris-be-your-guide"><a href="#How-do-sports-betting-odds-work-Let-Zalgiris-be-your-guide" class="headerlink" title="How do sports betting odds work? Let Žalgiris be your guide"></a>How do sports betting odds work? Let Žalgiris be your guide</h1><!-- Add image slug: "betting-odds-explained" -->

<p>In order to make educated bets on sporting events, it’s important to first understand how sports betting odds work. Simply put, odds represent how likely a particular outcome is to happen. In order to calculate the payout on a bet, you need to know both the odds for each outcome and your bet amount.</p>
<p>There are two types of sports betting odds - fractional and decimal. Fractional odds are the traditional UK style, while decimal odds are more common in Europe and Australia. The calculation is the same for both types - simply divide your bet by the odds to get your profit (or multiply your stake by the odds to get your return). So, for example, if you risk £10 at 3/1 (4.00) odds, you would win £40 (£30 profit plus your original £10 stake back).</p>
<p>In order to convert fractional odds into decimal ones, divide the first number by the second number (e.g. 3/1 = 4.0). To convert decimal odds into fractional ones, divide the first number by the second number and then multiply by 100 (e.g. 1.5 = 150).</p>
<p>Now that you know how to calculate payouts, let’s take a look at some common betting scenarios:</p>
<p>Match Winner<br>Odds for a match winner usually range from 1/5 (1.20) up to 5/1 (6.00), depending on the sport and level of competition. As a general rule, favourite teams have shorter odds than underdogs. For example, if Manchester United are playing Wigan Athletic in a Premier League match, United would be the favourites with shorter odds than Wigan Athletic - who would be considered underdogs.<br>You can place bets on either team to win or opt for a draw instead (which pays out at 8/1 or 9/1 depending on the bookmaker). Another option is handicap betting where one team is given a head start (or deficit) in order to make the result more fair overall - this is particularly popular in football matches where one team may be much stronger than another.<br>To calculate payouts using match winner odds, simply multiply your stake by the payout multiplier (e.g. £10 at 2/1 = £20 profit). So if Man Utd beat Wigan Athletic 3-0 as predicted with Matchwinner Odds of 1/6 (1.17), you would receive £3 back for every £6 you staked (£18 total return). If Wigan Athletic manages an unlikely victory however with MatchWinner Odds of 16/1 (17), you would receive just £160 back from a £10 stake (£1000 total returned).</p>
<p>Total Goals Scored &amp; Correct Score Markets  Correct scores can offer much higher returns than simply predicting which team will win - especially if there’s big value in backing an outsider to pull off an upsetresult! For example, Chelsea may be offered at 11/4 (3.75) to win 2-0 against Liverpool but much longer odds of 33/1 (34) to win 5-4! In order to calculate payouts using correct score markets, simply work out how much money you’d receive if your chosen scoreline came in and then divide by 100 (e..g If Liverpool won 2-1 against Chelsea as per your prediction giving Correct Score Odds of 9/2 (£45 return), divide 45 by 100 = 0..45).</p>
<p> Totals markets aresimilarly another great way of sneakingvalue when betting on football matches - these markets allow youto beton whetherthe total goals scoredin amatch willbe over ordespite(under).[ [Image:<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imagesvc/">https://imagesvc</a> .photos .yahoo .com /hv/photos?bn=180251583&amp;sid=2&amp;mid=60SkgxNttnACaAj7VfZbMUw]]</p>
