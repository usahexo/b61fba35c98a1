        <h1 id="Bears-hope-to-extend-their-lead-in-the-NFC-North-with-a-win-over-the-Lions"><a href="#Bears-hope-to-extend-their-lead-in-the-NFC-North-with-a-win-over-the-Lions" class="headerlink" title="Bears hope to extend their lead in the NFC North with a win over the Lions!"></a>Bears hope to extend their lead in the NFC North with a win over the Lions!</h1><p>Sunday, the Bears will attempt to extend their lead in the NFC North when they take on the Lions. This is a big game for both teams, as a win would give the Bears an insurmountable lead in the division with only four games remaining, and it would also keep the Lions from getting back into the playoff picture.</p>
<p>The Bears come into this game having won two straight games, while the Lions have lost two of their last three. The Bears are led by quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has had a solid sophomore season. He has thrown for 2,469 yards and 20 touchdowns this year. The Lions’ offense is led by quarterback Matthew Stafford, who has thrown for 3,068 yards and 18 touchdowns this year.</p>
<p>The Bears’ defense is one of the best in the NFL. They are led by linebacker Khalil Mack, who was recently named Defensive Player of the Year. The Lions’ defense is ranked 30th in the NFL, so the Bears should be able to move the ball and score points on Sunday.</p>
<p>I expect this to be a close game, but I believe that the Bears will come out on top and extend their lead in the NFC North.</p>
<h1 id="What-time-is-checkout-at-the-Chicago-Bears’-hotel"><a href="#What-time-is-checkout-at-the-Chicago-Bears’-hotel" class="headerlink" title="What time is checkout at the Chicago Bears’ hotel?"></a>What time is checkout at the Chicago Bears’ hotel?</h1><p>The Chicago Bears are scheduled to checkout of their hotel at 11am on Sunday, January 3. This information was confirmed by the Bears’ Director of Football Administration, Chase Blackburn.</p>
<h1 id="Lions-hope-to-keep-up-their-winning-streak-against-divisional-rivals-the-Bears"><a href="#Lions-hope-to-keep-up-their-winning-streak-against-divisional-rivals-the-Bears" class="headerlink" title="Lions hope to keep up their winning streak against divisional rivals, the Bears!"></a>Lions hope to keep up their winning streak against divisional rivals, the Bears!</h1><p>The Detroit Lions are coming off of a big overtime victory against the Atlanta Falcons and they are looking to keep the momentum going this week as they take on divisional rivals, the Chicago Bears. The Lions have had the Bears’ number in recent years, winning the last three matchups, but this Bears team is looking to change that.</p>
<p>The Bears come into this matchup with a 3-1 record, thanks in part to their stout defense. They are currently ranked first in total defense and scoring defense, allowing only 12.8 points per game. Their offense has been inconsistent so far this season, but they will be facing a Lions defense that is ranked 21st in total defense and has given up an average of 27 points per game.</p>
<p>The Lions will need to rely on their offense to carry them in this matchup. Quarterback Matt Stafford has been playing well so far this season and he will need to continue that trend against the Bears’ tough defense. Wide receiver Golden Tate has also been playing well, accounting for 428 yards and three touchdowns receiving so far this season. The Lions will need him to continue to be a big playmaker if they hope to win on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Bears have a few players that can hurt the Lions on offense. Running back Jordan Howard has been one of the best running backs in the NFL over the past two seasons and he will likely be a big challenge for the Lions’ defense. Wide receiver Allen Robinson has also been playing well for the Bears, recording 313 yards and four touchdowns receiving so far this season. If these two players can have big games, it could be tough for the Lions to win.</p>
<p>This should be a great matchup between two teams who are both looking to improve their playoff standing. The Lions have had the edge over the Bears in recent years, but this Bears team is looking like a legitimate playoff contender. It should be an exciting game to watch!</p>
<h1 id="Chicago-Bears-looking-to-dominate-Detroit-Lions-in-this-matchup"><a href="#Chicago-Bears-looking-to-dominate-Detroit-Lions-in-this-matchup" class="headerlink" title="Chicago Bears looking to dominate Detroit Lions in this matchup!"></a>Chicago Bears looking to dominate Detroit Lions in this matchup!</h1><p>The Chicago Bears are gearing up to take on the Detroit Lions in a Week 10 matchup that is sure to be explosive.</p>
<p>The Bears come into this game with a 3-5 record, while the Lions sit at 4-4. This is definitely a game that the Bears need to win in order to keep their playoff hopes alive.</p>
<p>The Bears have been playing much better lately, thanks in part to the emergence of rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. The team is looking to build on their recent success and take down their division rivals on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Lions have been up and down this season, but they definitely pose a threat to the Bears. Quarterback Matthew Stafford is one of the best in the league, and he has some dangerous weapons at his disposal.</p>
<p>The Bears will need to play mistake-free football if they want to come away with a win on Sunday. They have shown that they are capable of doing just that, and they will need to be at their best against a tough Lions team.</p>
<p>If the Bears can come away with a victory on Sunday, it would be a huge momentum boost for them as they head into the second half of the season.</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-come-out-on-top-in-this-exciting-game-the-Bears-or-the-Lions"><a href="#Who-will-come-out-on-top-in-this-exciting-game-the-Bears-or-the-Lions" class="headerlink" title="Who will come out on top in this exciting game - the Bears or the Lions?!"></a>Who will come out on top in this exciting game - the Bears or the Lions?!</h1><p>In this exciting game, the Bears and the Lions will compete to see who comes out on top. The Lions have had a strong season so far, but the Bears are determined to win.</p>
<p>The Lions have a lot of talent on their team, including quarterback Matthew Stafford and wide receiver Golden Tate. Stafford has been playing well this season, and Tate is one of the best receivers in the league. The Lions also have a strong running game with Ameer Abdullah and Theo Riddick.</p>
<p>The Bears have a lot of talent too, including quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and wide receiver Allen Robinson. Trubisky is still a rookie, but he has shown potential this season. Robinson is one of the most explosive receivers in the NFL. The Bears also have a strong running game with Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen.</p>
<p>This game is sure to be exciting. Both teams have strong offenses and defenses, so it will be tough for either team to pull ahead. It’s going to come down to who makes the fewest mistakes and who can take advantage of opportunities when they arise.</p>
<p>I think the Bears will come out on top in this game. They have more talent on their team, and they are playing at home. The Lions are a good team, but I think the Bears are going to be too much for them.</p>
