#  What amenities are included in the rent?

When you are looking for a new place to live, one of the most important factors to consider is what amenities are included in the rent. This will help you to determine how much you will need to budget for each month.

Here are some of the most common amenities that are included in rent:

* water

* sewage

* trash removal

* heat

* air conditioning

* parking

Keep in mind that some of these amenities may come at an extra cost, so be sure to ask about that before you sign any lease agreements.

#  What is the minimum lease term?

When you are looking for an apartment, one of the most important things to consider is the minimum lease term. This is the minimum amount of time you will be required to stay in the apartment before you are allowed to break your lease without penalty.

Most leases have a minimum lease term of six months, but some may be as short as three months or as long as 12 months. It is important to know what the minimum lease term is before you sign your lease, because if you need to move sooner than expected, you will be penalized.

If you need to move before the end of your lease, you will likely need to pay for breaking your lease early. This penalty fee can be expensive, so it is important to consider all of your options before signing a lease with a minimum lease term.

If you are not sure whether you will be able to stay in your apartment for the entire lease term, it may be a good idea to look for an apartment with a shorter minimum lease term. This will allow you more flexibility if something unexpected comes up and you need to move sooner than expected.

#  Are any furnishings provided?

When you are moving into a new place, one of the questions you are likely to ask is whether or not any furniture is provided. This can be an important question, as it can save you from having to purchase all of your furniture right away. In some cases, the answer may be no, but in others, the landlord may provide some furniture or at least allow you to bring in your own.

If the answer is no, you will need to start looking for furniture. This can be a daunting task, but there are a few things that can make it a bit easier. First, decide what kind of furniture you need. Do you want a couch and chairs? A bed and dresser? Something else entirely? Once you have an idea of what you need, start looking for specific pieces.

There are a number of places to find furniture, both online and in stores. Be sure to compare prices before making a purchase, as well as read reviews from other buyers. Another thing to keep in mind is size; make sure everything you buy will fit in your new place!

If the answer is yes, however, there are still some things you'll want to keep in mind. For example, if the furniture is old or worn out, it may be time for an upgrade. Additionally, if your new place has a different layout than your old one, you may need to rethink your furniture arrangement.

In either case, it's important to discuss furnishings with your landlord before moving in. This way, there aren't any surprises and everyone is on the same page.

#  What is the pet policy?

Many landlords have a pet policy, which is a set of rules landlords put in place about how many and what kind of pets are allowed on the property. Pets can include animals such as cats, dogs, birds, fish, and reptiles.

Pets policies often state that certain breeds of dogs are not allowed, or that a certain number of pets is the maximum. Some landlords require pet deposits and/or monthly pet rent to be paid by tenants who have pets.

Landlords may also have rules about where pets can be walked and whether they are allowed on furniture or in the yard. It’s important for tenants to be familiar with their landlord’s pet policy before they move in so there are no surprises down the road.

#  How close is the nearest bus stop/train station?

When considering moving to a new area, one of the first questions you may ask is how close the nearest bus stop or train station is. Luckily, there are a few ways to go about finding this information.

One way is to use Google Maps. Simply enter your current location and the address of the desired destination and Google Maps will show you the route, as well as how long it will take to walk there. The map will also indicate whether or not there is a bus stop or train station near by.

Another way to find public transportation information is through an app like Moovit or Transit. Both of these apps allow you to search for a specific address or intersection and will show you all of the available public transportation options, including how far away the nearest stop is.

If you're already familiar with the area you're moving to, you can also check out the local transit authority's website or app. This information will usually be listed under "Getting Around" or "Transit". By looking at a map, you can get an idea of where each transit stop is in relation to your home and work.

No matter which method you choose, it's important to do your research ahead of time so that you can factor in public transportation when deciding on a new home.
