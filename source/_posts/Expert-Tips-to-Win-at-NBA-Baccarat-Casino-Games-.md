#  How to play and win baccarat casino games 

Casino baccarat games are one of the simplest casino games you can play. The game is easy to learn and you can be playing in no time at all. Many people enjoy playing baccarat because it offers relatively good odds, even for beginning players.

The basic aim of the game is to beat the banker's hand or to have a hand total as close to 9 as possible. You can bet on either the player or banker hand and winning bets are paid out at even money, minus a 5% commission taken by the casino on winning banker bets.

To play, first choose how much you want to wager. Once you have placed your bet, two cards are dealt face up to both the player and banker hands. The value of each card is totalled and if either hand has a value of 8 or 9 then that is known as a 'natural' and no further cards are drawn. If either hand has a value of less than 8, then a third card is drawn for that hand depending on what the value is.

For example, if the player hand totals 5 and the banker hand totals 2, then the player would need another 3 (6 total) to get to 9 and win - this would mean they would take another card. If, however, the player had a 6 (total 7) then they would stand as they cannot go above 9 with just two cards.

The best way to learn how to play baccarat is to simply practice! You can find free versions of the game online or in some casinos so that you can try different strategies before putting your money down. There is also no need to worry about complex rules - the basic premise of the game is very simple!
