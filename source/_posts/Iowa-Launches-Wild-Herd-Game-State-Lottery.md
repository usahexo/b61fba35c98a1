#  Oklahoma Authorizes New Wild Herd Game Lottery

The Oklahoma Wildlife Commission has voted unanimously to authorize a new wild herd game lottery. The lottery will allow hunters the opportunity to purchase a license to hunt an animal from a specific herd of deer, elk, or antelope. Licensed hunters will then be able to take a trophy animal from the herd.

"This is an exciting opportunity for our sportsmen and women," said Commissioner Bob Hughes. "The lottery will provide an additional hunting opportunity and give hunters the chance to take a trophy animal from a specific herd."

Applicants for the lottery will be able to choose from either deer, elk, or antelope herds. The commission will approve up to three herds each year for the lottery.

A total of 125 licenses will be available in each lottery. The licenses will cost $1,000 apiece and will be valid for one year. Winners of the lottery will have the opportunity to harvest an animal from the selected herd.

"We are pleased to offer this new hunting opportunity to our sportsmen and women," said Hughes. "The wild herd game lottery will provide a unique hunting experience for those who participate."

#  West Virginia Approves Controversial Wild Herd Game Gambling Operation

CHARLESTON, W.Va. – In a unanimous vote by the state’s gaming board, West Virginia has OKed a controversial new wild herd game gambling operation that allows people to bet on the movements of deer, elk, and other wildlife.

The new game is already being dubbed “Big Buck Hunter 2.0” by some in the hunting community, and is sure to bring in big bucks for the state’s coffers.

Under the new regulations, gamblers can place bets on individual animals or on herds of animals at certain designated locations across the state. The winning bidder will receive a percentage of the animal’s carcass based on its size and sex.

While hunters are generally in favor of the game, many conservationists are raising concerns about its negative impact on wildlife populations and habitats. Some worry that it could lead to increased poaching and hunting violations.

Supporters of the game argue that it will help create jobs and generate revenue for the state, while providing a new recreational opportunity for hunters and outdoors enthusiasts. They say that it will also help to manage overpopulation of deer and other ungulates, which can have negative consequences for plant life and other wildlife.

So far there has been no announcement as to when the game will go into effect, but officials say they are working to put all of the necessary regulations in place as soon as possible.
