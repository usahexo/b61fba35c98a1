#  How to Play Hot Shot Slot Machine like a Pro 

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world. The Hot Shot slot machine is one of the most popular slot machines and it can be played by anyone. However, there are a few tips and tricks that can help players play this game like a pro.

The first thing that players need to do is understand how to play the game. Hot Shot is a five-reel slot game with nine pay lines. Players need to bet one coin on each pay line in order to activate all of them. The amount that they can bet ranges from one penny to twenty-five cents per coin. In order to win the jackpot, players need to hit three symbols on the ninth pay line.

Once players understand how to play the game, they need to decide how much they want to bet on each spin. This will depend on their budget and how much they want to risk. It is important for players not to bet more than they can afford to lose as this could lead to them losing money that they cannot afford to lose.

Players also need to select their bets carefully as some combinations offer bigger payouts than others. For example, betting two coins on a single pay line will usually result in a payout of four coins, whereas betting two coins on multiple pay lines might only result in a payout of two coins. However, it is important for players not to spread their bets too thinly as this could mean that they do not win anything at all.

Now that players have chosen their bets, it is time to start playing the game. The first step is to press the “spin” button which will cause the reels to start spinning. If players want to speed up the process, they can press “autoplay” which will cause the reels to spin automatically for a predetermined number of spins.

Players should keep an eye out for special symbols such as wilds and scatters as these can help them win big prizes. Wilds are symbols which can be used as substitutes for other symbols in order to create winning combinations while scatters are symbols which can award free spins and bonuses when three or more appear anywhere on the reels. 

Finally, players should always make sure that they collect their winnings after each spin. This can be done by pressing the “collect” button which will add any winnings accumulated during that spin into the player’s balance meter at the bottom of the screen.
