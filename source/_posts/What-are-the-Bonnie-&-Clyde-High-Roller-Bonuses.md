#  How do you play the Bonnie & Clyde Game?

The Bonnie & Clyde Game is a two-player game that can be played with a deck of cards. The object of the game is to score points by taking as many cards as possible from your opponent while keeping as many of your own cards as possible.

To begin the game, each player draws four cards from the deck. The player with the highest card starts the game and play passes clockwise. On a player's turn, they must play one card from their hand. The card played must be higher than the previous card played, or if it is the same rank, then the suit must be different. If a player cannot play a card, they must draw one from the deck and then play one. If a player cannot play or draw, then they lose their turn.

The first player to run out of cards wins the game and scores points based on the rank of the cards left in their opponent's hand. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack (J), Queen (Q) or King (K) are each worth 10 points. The winner of the game is the first player to reach 100 points or more.
