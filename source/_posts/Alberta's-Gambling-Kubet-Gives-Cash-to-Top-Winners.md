#  Alberta Gambling Kubet Gave More Than $25 million in Prizes in 2016

Alberta gambling generated more than $25 million in prizes in 2016, according to data recently released by the province’s Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC).

The lion’s share of that total — more than $19.5 million — was won on slot machines, which saw a 5.6 per cent uptick in payouts over 2015. Keno also generated big bucks for players, with payouts reaching nearly $2.7 million last year, up from just under $2.3 million in 2015.

Table games such as blackjack, poker and roulette accounted for the remaining winnings, totalling just over $3 million for 2016.

The news comes as no surprise to AGLC spokesperson Chara Goodings, who says the increased prize money is indicative of Alberta’s strong economy.

“With the improved economic conditions in Alberta, we are seeing increased casino play and correspondingly higher payouts to players,” she said.

Goodings also stressed that the vast majority of gamblers do so responsibly, with less than one per cent of players accounting for the majority of prize money won.

“The majority of our customers gamble within their means and enjoy the entertainment and occasional chance of winning a larger prize without any negative impacts on their life or finances,” she said.

#  Who Gets the Most Money from Alberta Gambling Kubet?

Alberta has a gambling problem, and everyone knows it. The province is home to some of the most profitable casinos in the world, and it seems like nearly everyone is getting rich off of it – except for the taxpayers.

According to a study by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF), the top 10 individuals in Alberta who benefit from gambling are taking in a combined total of $27 million per year. That’s an average of $2.7 million each – and it doesn’t even include the profits that go to businesses like hotels and restaurants that service the casinos.

The CTF’s Greg Thomas said that this is a “wastefulness of money that could be going towards health care, education or other priorities”. He added that “the Alberta government should be looking at ways to reduce these outlandish payouts instead of increasing taxes or fees on everyday Albertans”.

So who are these lucky few? According to the CTF, the top 10 beneficiaries are:

1. Ralph Klein – $5.9 million
2. Daryl Katz – $4 million
3. Philip Anschutz – $3 million
4. Connie McCagherty – $2.7 million
5. Nelson Skalbania – $2.5 million
6. Irving Gerstein – $2 million
7. Deron Smith – $1.8 million
8. John Andrew Harrell III – $1.5 million
9. The Ganzburgs – $1 million
10. Garth Drabinsky -$940 thousand

#  Alberta Gambling Kubet Winners Announced

The Gambling Kubet commission announced the winners of the Alberta Gambling Kubet. The grand prize went to Ronald Dean who won a $1 million jackpot.

Dean, who has been unemployed for six months, said he plans to use the money to buy a house and a new car. “I’ve been playing this game for years and I’ve never won anything like this before,” he said.

Other winners included Douglas Heffernan, who won $25,000 playing slots; Annie Wong, who won $10,000 playing blackjack; and Michael Campbell, who won $5,000 playing roulette.

Alberta Gambling Kubet is a new casino game that has quickly become popular in the province. The game is a hybrid of blackjack and bingo, and players can win cash prizes by matching numbers on their cards with those called out by the dealer.

Gambling Kubet commissioner Don Hogg said the game has been a big hit with players since it was launched last year. “There’s something about this game that really appeals to people,” he said. “It’s fun and exciting to play, and there are lots of chances to win big prizes.”

Hogg said the commission is planning to launch a new version of the game later this year that will include even more prizes. He urged players to try out the game and see for themselves how much fun it can be.
