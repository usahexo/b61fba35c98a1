#  Nine Tails Games accused of scamming players out of money

Nine Tails Games, an indie game studio, is being accused of scamming players out of money. Players have taken to social media to express their anger over the studio's allegedly deceptive business practices.

Nine Tails Games has been in operation for about two years and has developed a few small games that have been released on mobile platforms. The company's latest game, "Innocent Forest 2", was released on Steam earlier this month.

Shortly after the game's release, several players took to social media to express their concerns that the game was a scam. These players claimed that the game was advertised as a free-to-play title, but that they were charged money for in-game items without their consent.

One player even uploaded a video showing how they were charged $5 without their knowledge. The player claims that they only played the game for a few minutes before being charged.

Nine Tails Games has since responded to these allegations, denying any wrongdoing. The studio claims that the charges were made deliberately by players in order to access premium content in the game without paying.

This statement has done little to quell the anger of players who have lost money as a result of Nine Tails Games' alleged deception.Many are calling for a boycott of the studio's games until it compensates those who have been scammed.

#  Casino refusing to pay out winnings to players

Casinos are often in the news for all the wrong reasons. In this article, we'll take a look at one casino that is refusing to pay out winnings to players.

The casino in question is called Royal Vegas and it is based in Malta. It has been caught refusing to pay out winnings to players who have won money playing games such as blackjack and roulette.

One player, who goes by the name of 'John', said that he had won €7,000 from playing blackjack. However, the casino refused to pay him his winnings, saying that the game was rigged.

This isn't the first time that Royal Vegas has been caught refusing to pay out winnings to players. In fact, it's been caught doing this on numerous occasions. Players have even taken the casino to court over this issue, but it has always managed to get away with not paying out what they owe.

It's clear that Royal Vegas is a casino that can't be trusted. If you win money while playing games there, don't expect to actually receive your winnings.

#  Is Nine Tails Games a safe and reliable online casino?

The first thing that you need to do is to find out if Nine Tails Games is a safe and reliable online casino. This is because you don't want to end up getting scammed and lose your money. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to determine if an online casino is safe and reliable.

One of the best ways to determine if an online casino is safe and reliable is by looking at its licensing and regulation. You can usually find this information on the casino's website. If the casino does not have any licensing or regulation information on its website, then it is best to stay away from it.

Another way to determine if an online casino is safe and reliable is by looking at its customer reviews. If the casino has a lot of negative reviews, then it is best to stay away from it. However, if the casino has a lot of positive reviews, then it may be worth giving it a try.

Lastly, you can also use online safety protocols, such as SSL encryption, to determine if an online casino is safe and reliable. If the casino uses SSL encryption, then it means that your personal and financial information will be protected when you use the site.
